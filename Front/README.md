    # Description: This program simulates a virtual wallet. It allows users to create an account,
    #              deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance.
    #              It also includes a function to transfer money between accounts.
    #              The program uses a dictionary to store user accounts, where each key is a username
    #              and each value is another dictionary containing the user's balance and account number.
    #              The program also includes a function to display all user accounts and their balances.
    #              The program uses a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit 
    #              The program uses a try/except block to handle potential errors, such as invalid input
    #              The program uses a function to validate user input to ensure it is a valid username and
    #              password.
